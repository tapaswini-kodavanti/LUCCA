# LUCCA: Large Language Models under Conversational Cognitive Architectures

This project introduces Conversational Cognitive Architectures (LUCCA), an LLM-centric framework for social interaction that combines modular memory, prompt engineering, and internal reasoning to enable personalized, context-aware conversations. Through conversational scenarios and an HRI study, it demonstrates a lightweight yet effective alternative to traditional cognitive architectures for robotic systems.
